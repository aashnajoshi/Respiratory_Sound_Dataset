# Respiratory_Sound_Dataset
This repository contains a refined version of the Respiratory Sound Database, collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database/data). The dataset includes respiratory sound recordings, which can be used for machine learning models aimed at detecting lung conditions like wheezes and crackles.

## Features
- High-quality respiratory sound recordings.
- Suitable for research and machine learning applications related to respiratory health.
- Preprocessed data for efficient use in model training and testing.

## Usage
This repository provides the dataset in a well-organized structure. To use the dataset, simply download the files and use them for your machine learning or signal processing tasks.

## Description of files:
- **/audio**: Contains the audio files of respiratory sounds.
- **/annotations**: Includes the annotations for each audio file, such as the presence of crackles and wheezes.
- **/metadata**: Metadata about each subject, including age, gender, and diagnosis.

## Acknowledgment
This dataset is a refined form of the original data collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database/data).
